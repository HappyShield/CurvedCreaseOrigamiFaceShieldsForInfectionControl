1. **HappyShieldFoldingCurveGenerator**: This parametric design tool may be used to generate designs for curved crease origami face shields as described in the above article. This tool is implemented using Rhinoceros and Grasshopper.
2. **HappyShield3DScanValidation**: These files show the procedure used for the comparison of the analytical geometry prediction and a 3D scan mesh of a curved-crease origami face shield design described in the above article. This procedure is implemented using Rhinoceros and Grasshopper. The 3D scan mesh and analytical geometry prediction (without the validation procedure) are also provided as a .obj file.
3. **HappyShield2DDesign**: This .dxf file contains the 2D folding and cutting curves of the curved crease origami face shield design described in the above article.
